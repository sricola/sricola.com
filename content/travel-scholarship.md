One of the best things about being in tech is having the opportunity to work, listen and engage with people from all stratas of society!

This scholarship is a small way for me to share my privilege to enable and push forward another URM's dreams. 

If you have a conference, talk and/or (anything else career related) that you would like to attend, and cannot monetarily afford to - **I am giving away one free roundtrip flight every quarter.**

## Guidelines
- United States domestic flights only, for now.
- While I don't discriminate on need and talent, this is specifically targeted at Under Represented Minorities (URMs) in tech.
- Travel has to be related to your field of work.
