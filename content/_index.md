Sri Ray works at the intersection of DevOps, Security and Doing the right thing. He searches for solutions that respect and compliment the Human element of systems. 

While not architecting systems or dreaming of the next improvement to make, he spends most of his free time on planes traveling around the only place we have all called home - Earth. 

He uses this opportunity to understand cultures and more importantly relish local food.
