      <description>One of the best things about being in tech is having the oppertunity to work, listen and engage with people from all stratas of society!
This scholarship is a small way for me to share my privelge to enable and push forward another URM&amp;rsquo;s dreams.
If you have a conference, talk and/or (anything else career related) that you would like to attend, and cannot monetarily afford to - I am giving away one free roundtrip flight every quarter.</description>

      <title>10 Things I have learnt after flying a Million Miles</title>
      <link>https://sricola.com/blog/after-a-million-miles/</link>

 Be kind to your cabin crew. They literally have your lives in their control. Service is their secondary job — getting you safely from A to B is their primary. And they do their jobs 100% of the time. On the topic of cabin crew, they only get paid on block time — door close to door open. Pre boarding help / stowing your luggage etc is literally volunteer time.</description>

      <title>Expressway Approach into LaGuardia</title>

      <description>One of the hardest places to land, in the world!
Disclaimer: I am not a pilot, just an airplane enthusiast. This is all from a passenger’s perspective.
One of the most exciting approaches has to be the Expressway Visual Approach into New York’s LaGuardia airport. It is apparently a very challenging approach that has to be done manually, which is alien to most pilots in this day and age where most of the flying, approaches and landings are all automated by technological awesomeness.</description>

      <description>Completed 30 in SF. Treated myself to nitrogen infused ice cream. Flew to Korea on Christmas Day. Rang in the new year in Hanoi, Vietnam.
January: Went to India to share in an old friend getting married. Flew to Doha and missed my connection to JFK thanks to the confusion caused by Donald Trump’s first attempt at the Muslim ban. Eventually landed in JFK to see people passed out in the arrivals section with signs reading “Wake me up, I am an immigration lawyer and can help”.</description>

      <description>The way you respond to a situation is almost as important as the remedy itself.
Every now and then, while in our line of duty, we are faced with a crisis. This is the story of Speedbird 38.  When the going gets tough, the tough get going. ~ JFKWhen dealing with technology; computers malfunction all the time, code always has bugs and users will always falter. Avoiding all those is nearly impossible, but minimizing the detrimental impact is definitely achievable.</description>

      <title>Digital Nomad Life: tech in my backpack</title>
      <link>https://sricola.com/blog/tech-in-my-backpack/</link>

      <description>Anything that goes into my backpack has to earn its place there.
This past year, I have lived in 6 continents, 17 countries, 7 time zones and 21 cities. All this while working a full time job, remotely.
Work is my primary goal. Work is what enables me to live this life. So obviously, being connected is the center of my focus. Additionally, I am part of the Infrastructure team at BuzzFeed, which means, I have to be oncall for a week every month and be generally available 24&amp;frasl;7, at other times.</description>

      <title>checklists: an operational gift</title>

      <description>No production operation is too small or too big for a checklist. Similarly, no situation is too strenuous for one. Always write one — it ensures smooth process! At BuzzFeed we love lists. I mean, we helped pioneer the list format! Lists are easily digestible and are clear and concise in their meaning. They are no replacement for a long form read, but hey, nobody’s got time to read a leather bound novel by a fireplace during a production operation.</description>

      <title>The Most Wanted iPhone 7 Feature Nobody Talks About</title>

      <description>Anyone who even remotely follows any technology oriented blog or website is probably well aware of the plethora of rumors and leaks that happen before any major consumer product announcement. This is more so true for rumors and leaks related to Apple. Partly to blame(credit?) for their secrecy when it comes to un-announced products — Apple somehow evokes consumer emotions — on levels that are unheard of. When was the last time CNN covered a queue of people waiting outside the Samsung store, days before a phone launch?</description>
