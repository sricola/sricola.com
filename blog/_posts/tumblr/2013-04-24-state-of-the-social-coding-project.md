The numbers speak for itself. 299 people have forked the repo so far. I have started handing control over to people who are actively engaging and those who ask.

It is astounding to see the response and I could not be happier. Every time there was a potentially negative commit, the community stepped in to defend. Total strangers at that too.&nbsp;True, one could argue that the resulting app does nothing useful, but it is encouraging to start more of these in the future, perhaps with a little direction to begin with (as against a blank text file and 5 rules). Or, you know, give this one some more rigid direction.

There have been functions that do cool things like retrieve a random tweet, weather conditions, ascii art and emotional ones that pay tribute to the victims of the&nbsp;Chinese&nbsp;earthquake.

I wish I could name each one of you and personally thank the 198 authors, but, THANK YOU ALL.

This is YOUR experiment.
