Honestly speaking, I am sick and tired of hearing everyone moan and groan about the features (or lack thereof) of the new, recently announced iPhone 5.

**iPhone isn’t god. Neither is apple.**

This coming from an atheist sounds weird. But I have got to make the case. Whatever your perceptions of god are and whatever you have come to expect apple to do, it is not going to happen. Apple is a technology company and the iPhone is a phone.

**The Honda Civic of phones.**

Mass market products cannot take cutting edge risks.&nbsp;The iPhone has made itself a mass market consumer product. It’s no longer the niche product it used to be. And quite frankly, neither is Apple, as a company. When was the last time someone got excited or complained about a new Honda Civic? Exactly my point. Honda has, over the years, established ingenious engineering marvels and put out cars that just work. That is exactly where Apple is with the iPhone.&nbsp;

**Its evolution, not a revolution.**

Revolutions are risky little undertakings that underdogs resort to. Believe me, I love being the underdog. Apple, however, is not. They are a sensible company that needs to satisfy their investors and the public at large. While a revolutionary device has the potential to be wildly successful, its a huge risk. Anyone remember the Edsel? No, I was not alive then either, but I love reading up on failures.

**But NFC and \<insert another fancy technology\> are pretty standard these days.**

Do you know what NFC stands for? Didn’t think so. I do and I also know that I have owned 2 different phones capable of NFC and have never ever used that darn Near Field Communication feature. Same goes with most other options that smart phones come with these days. [Beats Audio](http://beatsbydre.com/beatsaudio/Beats%20Audio,default,sc.html) is the biggest joke, I have ever seen heard. Smart marketing, HTC.

**Apple Fan Boy: “They sold out in one hour! Obviously people love the new iPhone”**

Did Tim Cook phone you to say how many units they manufactured? Didn’t think so. Also, they do not have to confess to selling out or not. They probably realized that the general public wasn’t too happy with the new phone and held back on the units they want to disperse at the moment. Artificial demand for supply that exists. You dont need to go to business school to figure that one out.

**Doesn’t it look exactly the same, but slightly taller?**

So does your 8 yr old, you dont exactly stop buying her new clothes do you? - terrible analogy, I know. Get the point though?

**In conclusion**

Reading through the many facebook posts that my friends put up, right after the announcement, [Graeme](https://twitter.com/bygriz) brought to my attention that Apple (with the iPhone) is a lot like Porche. More like the 911 to be precise. Stand a 911 from 40 years ago next to the one from a few years ago and spot the differences. ([Porche 911 evolution](http://l.sricola.com/RYlju4)) The design has not changed much. Yet, people with the money, still crave and want the latest 911.

The operating words being, people with the money. Which is my conclusion. If you have the money and the love, go buy the iPhone 5 and make sweet love to it. If you do not have the desire to get one, quit moaning. As for me, I shall be &nbsp;in line at the 5th Avenue store on launch day. The end.
