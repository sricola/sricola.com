 **Problem** : You have great music on your computer, and a great&nbsp;receiver&nbsp;and speakers. (where’s the problem sri?) They are not in the same room, or not even on the same floor.

**Scenario** : You have an android phone, wifi and a respectable IQ to follow along

**Solution** : Turns out, there is an app called ’[AirBubble](http://l.sricola.com/x0eN5W)’ that you can install on your Android phone that makes it listen for incoming streams of audio (much like how Apple’s [AirPlay](http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/) works)

After firing up AirBubble on your phone, go to your Mac, fire up iTunes, go to the bottom right and you should see your AirBubble device show up! Much like the pic below…

Now, just plug in anything with a 3.5mm headphone jack into your phone and you are done! psst. you can have as many AirBubble devices to stream to as you would like. :)
