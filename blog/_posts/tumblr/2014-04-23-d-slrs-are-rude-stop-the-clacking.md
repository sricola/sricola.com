Let me get to the point. I hate my DSLR. I love the granular control that it affords me and the flexibility in terms of lenses - but, I just find it incredibly rude in many ways.

Yes, I called a camera rude. And let me explain why. But before I do so, for the uninitiated, here is a quick general knowledge lesson.

DSLR - stems from SLR - which stands for&nbsp; **S** ingle- **L** ens&nbsp; **R** eflex. Back in the early days of film cameras, the film sat behind the lens and there was a view finder which you could look through to frame your shot. But the flaw was that the viewfinder (in fact another lens) was slightly above (or to the side) of the image capturing lens and what you saw wasn’t necessarily what the lens would capture. First world problems arose as people felt the need to perfectly frame the shot being taken - and the viewfinder had minute errors in it, as obviously the image lens and the viewfinder weren’t the same.

The solution - have just one lens - to view and to capture. But how would you see what is behind the film? Film can only be exposed once. Geniuses convened and decided to put a mirror in the mix - to reflect what the lens saw into a viewfinder above. Imagine it as a tiny little periscope. Thus the SLR was born.

To simplify the explanation of its inner workings - before capture, the mirror is in place and reflects the view into the viewfinder. When you hit the shutter button, the mirror moves out of the way and allows the film to be exposed and thus captures the image. Yes, the mirror physically moves out of the way. And that is what produces the [now commonly heard in every touristy place] &nbsp;-&nbsp;_ **clack clack&nbsp;** _ sound&nbsp;as the picture is being taken.

The film is long gone (yes, I hear a few hipsters begging to differ) and cameras these days now ship with digital image sensors. Hence the name Digital-SLR. Same principles apply - the mirror is in place and moves out of the way when the shutter is pressed.&nbsp;

The&nbsp;_ **clack** _ **&nbsp;_clack_** in my opinion is what makes this type of camera just incredibly rude. There have been so many scenarios where I have wanted to capture an image and have refrained because of the noise it makes. It is just so offensively rude! These scenarios usually arose in quieter places - inside churches and buildings. But also, just generally on the street or just about anywhere in public.

I hate to be a bothersome **_clacker -_&nbsp;** yup, I just made that word to describe annoying DSLR shooters that walk around everywhere.

**How do we solve this?** Here are some attempts being made that aren’t perfect by any means - but are pretty good attempts.

_Use a Digital Viewfinder_- sounds like a brilliant idea. Use a digital LCD screen to show what the lens and eventually the sensor will capture. In fact, it uses the same sensor to render the “_live view”._&nbsp;Most semi-amateur photographers will jump up in arms complaining that the refresh rate is too low - and it is impractical to capture fast moving activity with precision. Added to the fact that LCD screens suck in bright light. Also the unreliability of LCD screens to perfectly reproduce color and contrast - makes it hard to adjust things like aperture and exposure and the billion other things you can tweak.

People these days call the above type - mirrorless cameras. But the term technically emcompasses every point and shoot ever made, including your phone. They all don’t have mirrors. Cameras like the Nikon J1 and V1 are marketed as mirrorless - when in fact they are technically mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras - allowing you to, unlike your phone and other point and shoots, change the lens.

_Do it the Leica way_ **&nbsp;** - this is by no means exclusive to the Leica line - but they did get it close to perfection. Use a separate viewfinder and draw make believe lines inside the viewfinder that actually represent the frame being captured. So, the viewfinder allows you to see the frame being captured and more, the lines in the viewfinder represent the borders of the frame and move according to focal length, etc. Lots of laws of optics involved - but it works pretty darn well.&nbsp;

**The Million Dollar Solution**

Be sure to pay me royalties if you do infact make this perfect and are successful in banishing&nbsp;_ **clackers** _ the world over.

Use technology. Move the mirror behind the sensor. Yes, behind the sensor, and have it fixed. Don’t take away from the joys of looking through a viewfinder - keep the optical viewfinder where it is, and reflect the image using a mirror - that is **fixed**. Here comes the hard part - make the sensor a permeable membrane that allows light to pass through unhindered - hence allowing the viewfinder to function as is inspite of the mirror behind it. When the shutter is pressed, use some chemical magic to restructure the above said membrane and capture the image. Voila!

No more clacking! And the world will be a better place, for you, me and everyone else.

Until this becomes reality - as an avid amateur photographer myself - I appeal to you to stop clacking in places it is not appropriate.
