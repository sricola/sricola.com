The journey of a thousand miles, begins with one small step. Sure. But did anyone ever tell you that a journey of a thousand miles also has this view in the end?

**Cabot Trail, Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada ([map](http://l.sricola.com/capebreton)).** Put it on your bucket list right now. I have seen a lot of the United States and Canada - but have never experienced or seen such beauty ever before.

Its like, a cross between the mountains of West Virginia and the open waters of the Florida Keys - with Jennifer Aniston bathing in the nude in the midst of it all. Take it from me, it is just absolutely, astonishingly, strikingly, breathlessly,&nbsp;awe inspiringly&nbsp;magnificent.

It is also a driver’s paradise, the steep, gentle roll of the mountains - with a 80kmph speed limit. 80kmph?!! That is around 50mph for you non metric folk. &nbsp;You don’t have to worry too much about the speed limit, you will never exceed it no matter how hard you push your car - your common sense will slow you down.

I cannot wait to go back. I have got to go back. It made the entire 1800 mile round trip absolutely worth it.
