I know what you are all thinking. In fact, I bet my future first born that you are thinking that I spent less than a 100 bucks on gas and baby pandas were saved.

Let me put it this way, I could have driven any of the amazingly fuel efficient non-hybrids and averaged about the same in raw MPG whilst having a little more fun sans the groaning little 1.6 litre petrol engine that the Prius packs.

Do not get me wrong. Toyota have done a&nbsp;marvelous&nbsp;job and it is the most technologically advanced car on the road, arguably. But it is utter rubbish.&nbsp;

Now that I got that off my chest. Let me quantify my statement a little bit more. At 75 MPH, the car barely squeezes out 37MPG. Add in a few hills and a steady grade through West Virginia, that figure drops to something smaller than my waist size.

The car is the worst at handling cross winds. I can still feel the chills as I felt the car almost slip away with those little gusts that mother nature packs. Toyota focussed so much on making it aerodynamic (front to back) that it looks like the Great Wall of China on the side profile.

At the end of it, I felt I had just got done playing a very lengthy game of mario kart on the wii. You know, that one where the steering wheel is in your hands, and is not attached to anything. The car handles like it has no personality.

I read a long time ago, that hybrids are actually dirtier than their petrol/diesel counterparts, if you factor in the ore and processes that the battery utilizes. And its eventual disposal.

Don’t get me wrong, I love the technology the car packs. And I really do wish it goes mainstream soon. But for now, I’d much rather do my next trip in a Chevy Malibu. There, I said it.
