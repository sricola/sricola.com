The number of amateurs walking around with a DSLR shooting in auto, is staggering. Why burden yourself with such a bulky device, not to mention the cost of it, when your good old phone can take just as good photos.

I have come to learn a few tricks which using my phone as my primary and only camera. The following were all shot on my phone.

As a great man once said, the best camera is the one you always have on you. I always have my phone on me and hence is a no brainer. Skip to the end for some tips. And share any more you have in the comments.

All the above were taken with my phone - a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - which by the way, isnâ€™t the best hardware/software combo around. The iPhone 5 definitely trumps it, but the same results can be achieved with virtually any modern smart phone.

Here are some helpful tips.

- Do NOT use flash, unless absolutely necessary. I have never turned on my flash - it makes photos look terrible. Low light? - Keep reading.
- Play around with the exposure values. Virtually every phone/camera has a setting called exposure. This essentially controls, um, the exposure - the amount of time the sensor is exposed to the view being taken. Lower exposure = darker photos (use in bright light). Higher exposure = lighter photos (use in low light scenarios).
- Touch to focus. Get those artistic blur effects without shitty instagram filters. Touch on the area you want to focus on. Smart phones do this really well.
- Scene modes: I do not use this option a lot, but I do go to it sometimes, to get macro shots (close up). If you have an iPhone and love macro photography, consider getting an ollo clip ([http://l.sricola.com/XXGhTG](http://l.sricola.com/XXGhTG))
- Keep steady! - This applies to any type of photography.
- Avoid HDR - its tricky to get HDR right. HDR basically means, 3 photos are taken (at low, high and normal exposure) and super imposed on each other. Taking 3 photos takes time for the phone, and in most cases ends up blurry, unless you are aware of the fact that you need to stay still. Also, HDR is so 2007, natural photos are where its at.
- Keep the light source behind you, always. Never try to take a photo with light hitting your lens from the front. It will refract, and look terrible.&nbsp;
- Delete your instagram account now. Filters took over the world last year. Natural photos are way more admirable.
