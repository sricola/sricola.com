I fell in love. Watched the Lion King on Broadway. Booked a flight ticket to Dallas, semi-drunk, came back the next day. Booked a flight ticket to India for 3 days, completely sober, was stuck for 4 months. Drove non-stop for 24 hours to Miami, had to do it all over again on the way back. Played cricket with proper gear for the first time, in upstate NY, of all places. I quit working for a place I loved, I quit before I found another job. Moved out of NYC, only to move back a few weeks later. Said goodbye to my biological father, he did not recognize me on my final visit. I learnt how to drive stick, the proper way.

I did 72 bus trips, 29 train rides, 13 flights, 2 road crossings into Canada and had numerous love affairs with Interstate 95 -Travelled over 30,000 miles across 6 countries and 3 continents. 413 Foursquare checkins and 548 tweets later, it has been a good darn year.

    Swing hard, every single ball, its hard to miss. Love is relative.
