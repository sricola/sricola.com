I was struggling in Kazakhstan. I didn’t know what I was doing. I couldn’t even buy a ticket to get on the train. Taxis wouldn’t take me anywhere. I was literally walking up the street like ‘I NEED A FRIEND’.&nbsp;

> I matched with this girl and she had spent a couple of years in the States, so she obviously spoke English and I was like, ‘Oh my god, you are now my best friend.’ She was the one who exposed the fact that I was eating horse meat in my burger. We’re still friends on Facebook.”
